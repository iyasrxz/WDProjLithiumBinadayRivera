### Description:
> **“Eteka Aneya Ivi” which translates to “Have you forgotten?” is a website developed by Binaday, Aliya Louise and Rivera, Brianna Aliah to relive the memories of Encantadia’s prime year—2016.** Encantadia is an original Filipino fantasy series produced by GMA, telling the story of four Sang'gres and their journey towards safekeeping of their land. It is a spin-off of the hit Encantadia show that aired in 2005. Many Filipino genZs, including us, grew up on this show—with echoes of laughter, tears, and anger that influenced our imaginations. **Through this website, we will deep dive into the history, lore, characters, and enchanta words.** This is to honor the memories that they have provided several Filipino kids with. They built our childhood, so it is now time for us to build something to appreciate the beauty of our own Philippine craft. **Ivo Live, alaala ng Encantadia!** *(Long live the memory of Encantadia)*

# Q3 Project Poposal Update Plan
### HTML Form:
The website requires users to create an account using an HTML sign-up form in order to access its exclusive content. Account creation allows the site to personalize the user experience and save user-specific data such as preferences and progress.

During registration, users are asked to choose their favorite 2016 Sang’gre. After successfully creating an account and logging in for the first time, the user is redirected to a personalized welcome page featuring their chosen Sang’gre. This page is designed as a one-time exclusive experience and will no longer be accessible on future logins. 

Registered users also gain access to the Enchanta Language Quiz, which is divided into three difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, and Hard. Because the quiz is linked to the user’s account, progress and scores are saved, allowing users to continue where they left off or retake any level at any time

* **Create Account**: Allows the user to create an account and immerse themselves into an experience made just for them.
