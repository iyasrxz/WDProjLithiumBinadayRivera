### Description
### “Eteka Aneya Ivi?” which translates to “Have you forgotten?” is a website developed by Binaday, Aliya Louise and Rivera, Brianna Aliah to relive the memories of Encantadia’s prime year—2016. Encantadia is an original Filipino fantasy produced by GMA that tells the story of four sanggres and their journey towards safekeeping of the land. It’s a spin-off of the hit Encantadia show aired on GMA during the year 2005. Many Filipino genZs, including us, grew up on this show with echoes of laughter, cries, and anger.
### In this website, the lore, characters, and enchanta words will be deep dived into. This is to honor the memories they have provided several Filipino kids with. They built our childhood, so it is now time for us to build something to appreciate the beauty of our own Philippine craft. Ivo Live, alaala ng Encantadia! (Long live the memory of Encantadia)
