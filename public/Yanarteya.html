                <p>In 2005, GMA Network aired Encantadia—an original Filipino Telefantasya Series directed by Mark A. Reyes that made them take the frontline against their rival company, ABS-CBN Station. You see, Encantadia was new; it was magical and provided viewers with an intimate connection to the series through the different kingdoms and element lores. 

Suzette Doctolero, the headwriter of the hit series, shared in an interview with PEP.ph that it took two years to start the production of Encantadia. The title was not originally Encantadia, it was something similar to the vibes of “Maria Makiling.” However, by the time that the proposed magical kingdom of the diwatas were to be used for another fantasy series, Mulawin—they came upon the name Encantadia; starting the legacy that will forever be remembered.

            <h3>2005: Where it all started</h3>
            <p>
                A magical realm divided into four main kingdoms: Lireo, Adamya, Sapiro, and Hathoria. The conflict arose when Hathoria decided to turn against the three kingdoms, fueled by their lust for more. The four sang’gres—Amihan, Danaya, Pirena, and Alena—are then tasked to be the new safekeepers of the gems and maintain peace in Encantadia. However, with Queen Minea favoring Amihan to take over the crown as the next queen, Pirena turned her back against her sisters—fully embodying her Hathorian blood. As the episodes gain momentum, the sisters will eventually reconcile and find peace within their sisterhood. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The series started May 2 of 2005 and ended with 160 episodes on December 9 of the same year. On December 12, just two days after the final episode of Encantadia, the second book aired titled, “Etheria”. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Etheria embodies the fifth kingdom who used to be the most powerful kingdom in Encantadia. When Memen and Ornia were killed by an Etherian, it sparked the first war in the enchanted realm, ultimately resulting in the kingdom’s demise. But, it was not permanent. The story revolves around Avria, the evil queen, wanting to restore the power Etheria once held. In order to protect Encantadia, the sang’gres will time travel in order to break the curse that’s attached to Cassandra—the last from Memen and Ornia’s bloodline. A ginintuang orasan will play a vital role in the telefantasya. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The installment ended on February 17, 2006 with 50 episodes. It was followed by the third installment—Encantadia: Pag-Ibig Hanggang Wakas, airing three days after the final episode of “Etheria”. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The final installment of the 2005-2006 Encantadia series revolves around the Sapiros. Fallen bathaluman, Ether, used her powers to fool the diwatas in order to free the entities from old Etheria. As the story ensued, many encantados died which included Alena. Her gem was then transferred to Pirena which later on was given to Armea—Alena’s daughter who became the queen of Sapiro. In the end, they were able to proclaim victory against the evil kingdom. It was also stated in the finale that the four sang’gres vanished, and stayed as nothing more than a myth in Encantadia. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The installment ended on April 28, 2006 with 48 episodes. In total, the three series of Encantadia had a total of 258 episodes. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Some of the prominent characters were: Sunshine Dizon as Pirena, Karylle Padilla as Alena, Diana Zubiri as Danaya, Iza Calzado as Amihan, Dingdong Dantes as Ybrahim, Jennylyn Mercado as Lira, Yasmien Kurdi as Mira, Francine Prieto as Avria, Angel Aquino as Ether, and Pen Medina as Hagorn.

            <h3>2016: Our Childhood</h3>
            <p>
                GMA decided to reboot the hit Encantadia series, 11 years after the first airing of the hit Telefantasya. The new sang’gres for the series are: Glaiza de Castro as Pirena, Gabbi Garcia as Alena, Sanya Lopez as Danaya, and Kylie Padilla as Amihan. Similar to the 2005 version, it became a massive hit among the Filipino people. Several parodies and even applications were created in support of this era. It ended May 19, 2017 with 218 episodes. For the lore, visit Serse Bua.

            <h3> 2025: The Present </h3>
            <p> 
                After the hit 2016 series, many Filipinos thought that a continuation would no longer be possible. However, Encantadia indeed has magic; in 2021 during GMA’s New Year special, they introduced “Encantadia Chronicles: Sang’gre” as a developing project to be aired eventually. May of 2025, the premiere date of June 16, 2025 was officially confirmed—making many Encantadiks ecstatic with the announcement. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The story behind Encantadia Chronicles: Sang’gre introduces a new villain, Mitena. Mitena, the queen of Mineave, is the twin sister of bathalumang Cassiopea. She despises the sang’gres and is on a mission to take over Encantadia. By this time, a new generation of gem-keepers are introduced, namely: Bianca Umali as Terra daughter of Danaya, Faith da Silva as Flamarra daughter of Pirena, Angel Guardian as Deia from Mineave, and Kelvin Miranda as Adamus son of Alena. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Originally, Gaiea was the keeper of the earth gem (brilyante ng lupa) however in an unfortunate encounter in the human realm, both Gaiea and Aquil were murdered. Terra on the other hand, was unaware of her heritage as a diwata because she naturally grew up in the human world. Based on the prophecies, she is the protagonist of the series.
            </p>
            <p>
                The old gem-keepers are still present and still have vital roles in the story. They are to resolve the current problems and issues in Encantadia with the upcoming episodes.
