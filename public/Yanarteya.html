                <p>In 2005, GMA Network aired Encantadia—an original Filipino Telefantasya Series directed by Mark A. Reyes that made them take the frontline against their rival company, ABS-CBN Station. You see, Encantadia was new; it was magical and provided viewers with an intimate connection to the series through the different kingdoms and element lores. 

Suzette Doctolero, the headwriter of the hit series, shared in an interview with PEP.ph that it took two years to start the production of Encantadia. The title was not originally Encantadia, it was something similar to the vibes of “Maria Makiling.” However, by the time that the proposed magical kingdom of the diwatas were to be used for another fantasy series, Mulawin—they came upon the name Encantadia; starting the legacy that will forever be remembered.

            <h3>2005: Where it all started</h3>
            <p>
                A magical realm divided into four main kingdoms: Lireo, Adamya, Sapiro, and Hathoria. The conflict arose when Hathoria decided to turn against the three kingdoms, fueled by lust for more. The four sang’gres—Amihan, Danaya, Pirena, and Alena—are then tasked to be the new safekeepers of the gems and maintain peace in Encantadia. However, with Queen Minea favoring Amihan to take over the crown as the next queen, Pirena also turned her back against her sisters—fully embodying her Hathorian blood. As the episodes gain momentum, the sisters will eventually reconcile and find peace within their sisterhood.

            <p>
                The series started May 2 of 2005 and ended with 160 episodes on December 9 of the same year. On December 12, just two days after the final episode of Encantadia, the second book aired titled, “Etheria”. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Etheria embodies the fifth kingdom who used to be the most powerful kingdom in Encantadia. When Memen and Ornia were killed by an Etherian, it sparked the first war in the enchanted realm, ultimately resulting in the kingdom’s demise. But, it was not permanent. The story revolves around Avria, the evil queen, wanting to restore the power Etheria once held. In order to protect Encantadia, the sang’gres will time travel in order to break the curse that’s attached to Cassandra—the last from Memen and Ornia’s bloodline. A ginintuang orasan plays a vital role in the telefantasya.

                The installment ended on February 17, 2006 with 50 episodes. It was followed by the third installment—Encantadia: Pag-Ibig Hanggang Wakas, airing three days after the final episode of “Etheria”.

            <p>
                The final installment of the 2005-2006 Encantadia series revolves around the Sapiros. Fallen bathaluman, Ether, used her powers to fool the diwatas in order to free the entities from old Etheria. As the story ensued, many encantados died which included Alena. Her gem was then transferred to Pirena which later on was given to Armea—Alena’s daughter who became the queen of Sapiro. In the end, they were able to proclaim victory against the evil kingdom. It was also stated in the finale that the four sang’gres vanished, and stayed as nothing more than a myth in Encantadia.
