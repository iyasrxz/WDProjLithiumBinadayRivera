                <h1>Conflicts: The main wars in Encantadia</h1>
                <p>Hathoria Vs. Sapiro: In the beginning when the four brilyantes were split and given to the four kingdoms, Hathoria became greedy.
                They aspired for things more than what they needed. 
                First, they attacked the Adamyans—encantados who protected the water gem. 
                Adamyans lack strength, hence why Hathoria got the brilyante ng tubig very easily. 
                They then prepared an army to attack Sapiro—creating the war against the two kingdoms. 
                In the end, the good won over the evil with Raquim (prince of Sapiro) having hold of the three brilyantes. 
                However, both Haring Arvak and Haring Armeo died during the war.
                </p>
                <p>
                Hathoria Vs. Lireo: The moment Pirena, the eldest of the four siblings switched sides—the feud between the two kingdoms worsened. During the peak of the war wherein Hathoria almost won, Hara Amihan sacrificed herself for the sake of peace in Encantadia.
                Fortunately, Hathoria did not gain the brilyante ng hangin.
                At the last breath of Amihan, she ordered the brilyante to go to Danaya and bring the news of her passing. 
                In the end, Danaya became the queen of Lireo, a decision that came from a letter written previously by Amihan. 
                On the other hand, Hagorn was not killed but rather imprisoned. 
                </p>
                <p>
                Ethereian War: When Ether and Avria lusted for power and wanted to bring back the prime of Etheria, a war ensued. 
                Most of the time during this era, they didn’t have a physical war. 
                It was mostly manipulations, disguise, and wits. For instance, when Avria wanted the brilyante ng lupa in
                exchange for peace—Danaya used her wits and created a fake version of the brilyante ng lupa. 
                The Etherian War didn’t end easily, it extended up until the final war.
                </p>
                <p>
                Final War: By this time, the sang’gres have finally reconciled with each other. 
                However, during the same timeline, Hagorn has already escaped the prison with the help of Ether. 
                In the final war, the evil forces were defeated with the help of old souls from the devas. 
                Amihan, Haring Raquim, Kahlil, and many more encantados came back to support the sang’gres. 
                </p>

                <h1>Dividing of Power: Ang mga brilyante</h1>
                <p>
                Thousands of years before Lireo now, Adhara, a fallen sang'gre, was one of the people who wanted to take advantage of the gem. 
                In one specific event where Adhara's forces came to attack Cassiopea's islands where the gem resided, Cassiopea, in order to protect Encantadia—went against bathalumang Emre and split the mother gem into four brilyantes. 
                The four brilyantes were then given to the four main kingdoms: Adamya, Sapiro, Lireo, and Hathoria. 
                </p>
                <p>
                Adamya is filled with inhabitants called Adamyans. They are small but wise, peaceful but lacks strength. They are led by pinunong Imaw and are the protectors of the bilyante ng tubig. Sapiro on the other hand is the home of Sapiryans. Unlike Adamyans, they value strength and martial prowess. 
                As the protectors of the brilyante ng lupa, they have the capability to heal wounds and talk to pashneas or animals; they are led by King Armeo. 
                Next is Lireo, the powerful kingdom home to many diwatas. 
                They are considered to be the most advanced kingdom in Encantadia. 
                Under Hara Minea’s guidance, Lireo houses the brilyante ng hangin, arguably the most powerful gem as it can take the life of any entity in one second. 
                Lastly, Hathoria is the kingdom of Hathors—the ruthless protectors of Encantadia under the leadership of Haring Arvak. They house the brilyante ng apoy, fit for their fiery strength during the battlefield. 
                </p>
                <p>
                Beyond the knowledge of many, there’s a fifth brilyante called brilyante ng diwa. 
                Paopao, a kid from the mortal realm, caught sight of the brilyante ng diwa and eventually became the successor of the gem. 
                </p>
                <p>
                Every brilyante has a kambal diwa who acts as the gabay diwas, or those who guide the keeper of the gem. 
                Throughout the whole Encantadia 2016, the brilyantes kept getting stolen back and forth, 
                but, it will always end up in the hands of the tagapangalaga.

                <h1> Familial Lineage: Sang'gres & Diwanis</h1>
                <p>
                Pirena is the daughter of Hagorn and Minea. She was conceived when Hagorn pretended to be Raquim and got Minea pregnant. 
                This malicious intent towards Minea originated from their nulled engagement because Minea chose the throne over him.  
                </p>
                <p>
                Amihan is the daughter of Raquim and Minea. 
                She is the prophecy child, created because of the authentic love shared between the two. 
                </p>
                <p>
                Danaya and Alena are full siblings. 
                They are the daughters of Enuo and Minea who didn’t really have any romantic relationships. 
                Enuo saved Amihan and in exchange, Emre gave him a privilege to be the father of two diwanis. 
                However, by law, he does not have any right over the sang’gres hence why he chose the mortal realm. 
                </p>
                <p>
                Mira is the daughter of Pirena and Gamil, a Lirean kawal. Pirena instantly killed Gamil as her pregnancy was nothing
                more than a scheme for revenge. 
                </p>
                <p>
                Lira is the daughter of Amihan and Ybrahim. She was also conceived with the guide of genuine love. 
                </p>
                <p>
                Mira and Lira, as part of Pirena’s revenge, were switched at birth. 
                Lira was brought into the mortal realm with the hopes of her fending for herself and eventually dying. 
                Mira, on the other hand, lived lavishly in Lireo.
                As the story progresses, the secrets will eventually make them the closest in Encantadia.

                <h1>Family Conflict: Where everything began</h1>
                <p>
                During the time that the crown was ought to be passed to the four sang’gres—a competition occurred. 
                In the competition, Pirena was determined to be the winner after defeating the enemy. 
                However, it was then revealed that Amihan was already chosen to be the queen. 
                This ignited rage in Pirena causing her to lash out. 
                Fueled by her anger, she then switched sides from Lireo to Hathoria where his father, Hagorn, resided.
                This marked the beginning of major conflicts in Encantadia.
                </p>
                <p>
                Between the sisters, specifically Alena and Amihan, there were many issues regarding love interests. 
                Both fell in love with Ybrahim, the lost son of Haring Armeo. 
                Both of them also ended up having a child from Ybrahim, 
                but in the end it was Ybrahim and Amihan who ended up together.
                </p>
                <p>
                Speaking of children, there were a lot of issues and lore regarding them. 
                During the peak rivalry and conflict between Amihan and Pirena, they both got pregnant and gave birth at similar
                times. Pirena switched their daughters and brought Amihan’s child into the human world with intentions
                to kill her. 
                However, Lira was blessed by the fairies with a natural kalasag (shield)—protecting her from anyone who aims to hurt and 
                kill her. Eventually, Pirena just left Lira in the human world where Lira was adopted and unaware of her powers. 
                Eventually it was discovered and caused major conflicts especially amongst the siblings.
                </p>
                <p>
                Another issue with children was with Danaya and Alena. Danaya killed Khalil, Alena’s son, in order to protect Lira.
                Khalil was manipulated to kill Lira to fulfill a prophecy, making him a threat to Encantadia. 
                </p>
                <p>
                We can say that with all the events in Encantadia, Alena was the most affected one. She lost her love one to her sister, and
                she lost her son because of her other sister. 
                Thankfully, throughout these familial conflicts within the sang'gres, 
                they were able to reconcile and find solace within each other.

                <h1> Chapter Closed: The ending </h1>
                <p>
                    After Amihan’s death, the crown was passed around the three sisters. 
                    It mainly stayed with Danaya, fulfilling the wish and letter of the late Reyna Amihan.
                    However, there were some instances wherein the crown was in the hands of Pirena and Alena. 
                    In the end, Danaya gave up the crown to Alena in order to marry Aquil. 
                    Similarly, Pirena also married a Punjabwe named Azulan. 
                    The ending of Encantadia 2016 showcased the new generation of Sang’gres, 
                    and a peek of the new threat in Encantadia—Cassiopea’s twin sister.
